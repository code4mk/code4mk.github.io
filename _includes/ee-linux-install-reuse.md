{% if section == "ee-install-intro" %}

To get started with Docker EE on {{ linux-dist-long }}, make sure you
[meet the prerequisites](#prerequisites), then
[install Docker](#install-docker-ee).

{% elsif section == "ee-url-intro" %}

To install Docker Enterprise Edition (Docker EE), you need to know the Docker EE
repository URL associated with your trial or subscription. These instructions
work for Docker EE for {{ linux-dist-long }} and for Docker EE for Linux, which
includes access to Docker EE for all Linux distributions. To get this
information:

- Go to [https://store.docker.com/my-content](https://store.docker.com/my-content).
- Each subscription or trial you have access to is listed. Click the **Setup**
  button for **Docker Enterprise Edition for {{ linux-dist-long }}**.
- Copy the URL from the field labeled
  **Copy and paste this URL to download your Edition**.

Use this URL when you see the placeholder text `<DOCKER-EE-URL>`.

To learn more about Docker EE, see
[Docker Enterprise Edition](https://www.docker.com/enterprise-edition/){: target="_blank" class="_" }.



{% elsif section == "ways-to-install" %}

You can install Docker EE in different ways, depending on your needs:

- Most users
  [set up Docker's repositories](#install-using-the-repository) and install
  from them, for ease of installation and upgrade tasks. This is the
  recommended approach.

- Some users download the {{ package-format }} package and install it manually
  and manage upgrades completely manually. This is useful in situations such as
  installing Docker on air-gapped systems with no access to the internet.



{% elsif section == "set-up-yum-repo" %}

1.  Remove any existing Docker repositories from `/etc/yum.repos.d/`.

2.  Temporarily store the Docker EE repository URL you noted down in the
    [prerequisites](#prerequisites) in an environment variable.
    This will not persist when the current session ends.

    ```bash
    $ export DOCKERURL='<DOCKER-EE-URL>'
    ```

3.  Store your Docker EE repository URL in a `yum` variable in `/etc/yum/vars/`.
    This command relies on the variable you stored in the previous step.

    ```bash
    $ sudo -E sh -c 'echo "$DOCKERURL/{{ linux-dist-url-slug }}" > /etc/yum/vars/dockerurl'
    ```

    {% if linux-dist == "rhel" %}

    Store your OS version string in `/etc/yum/vars/dockerosversion`. Most users
    should use `7`, but you can also use the more specific minor version,
    starting from `7.2`.

    ```bash
    $ sudo sh -c 'echo "7" > /etc/yum/vars/dockerosversion'
    ```

    {% endif %}

4.  Install required packages. `yum-utils` provides the `yum-config-manager`
    utility, and `device-mapper-persistent-data` and `lvm2` are required by the
    `devicemapper` storage driver.

    ```bash
    $ sudo yum install -y yum-utils \
      device-mapper-persistent-data \
      lvm2
    ```

{% if linux-dist == "rhel" %}
5.  Enable the `extras` RHEL repository. This ensures access to the
    `container-selinux` package which is required by `docker-ee`.

    ```bash
    $ sudo yum-config-manager --enable rhel-7-server-extras-rpms
    ```

    Depending on cloud provider, you may also need to enable another repository.

    For AWS:

    ```bash
    $ sudo yum-config-manager --enable rhui-REGION-rhel-server-extras
    ```

    > **Note**: `REGION` here is literal, and does *not* represent the region
    > your machine is running in.

    For Azure:

    ```bash
    $ sudo yum-config-manager --enable rhui-rhel-7-server-rhui-extras-rpms
    ```
{% endif %}

6.  Use the following command to add the **stable** repository:

    ```bash
    $ sudo -E yum-config-manager \
        --add-repo \
        "$DOCKERURL/{{ linux-dist-url-slug }}/docker-ee.repo"
    ```


{% elsif section == "install-using-yum-repo" %}

1.  Install the latest version of Docker EE, or go to the next step to install a
    specific version.

    ```bash
    $ sudo yum -y install docker-ee
    ```

    If this is the first time you are installing a package from a recently added
    repository, you will be prompted to accept the GPG key, and
    the key's fingerprint will be shown. Verify that the fingerprint matches
    `{{ gpg-fingerprint }}` and if so, accept the key.

2.  On production systems, you should install a specific version of Docker EE
    instead of always using the latest. List the available versions.
    This example uses the `sort -r` command to sort the results by version
    number, highest to lowest, and is truncated.

    ```bash
    $ sudo yum list docker-ee  --showduplicates | sort -r

    docker-ee.x86_64         {{ site.docker_ee_version }}.ee.2-1.el7.{{ linux-dist }}          docker-ee-stable-17.06
    ```

    The contents of the list depend upon which repositories you have enabled,
    and will be specific to your version of {{ linux-dist-long }}
    (indicated by the `.el7` suffix on the version, in this example). Choose a
    specific version to install. The second column is the version string. You
    can use the entire version string, but **you need to include at least to the
    first hyphen**. The third column is the repository name, which indicates
    which repository the package is from and by extension its stability level.
    To install a specific version, append the version string to the package name
    and separate them by a hyphen (`-`):

    > **Note**: The version string is the package name plus the version up to
    > the first hyphen. In the example above, the fully qualified package name
    > is `docker-ee-17.06.1.ee.2`.

    ```bash
    $ sudo yum -y install <FULLY-QUALIFIED-PACKAGE-NAME>
    ```

    Docker is installed but not started. The `docker` group is created, but no
    users are added to the group.

3.  Edit `/etc/docker/daemon.json`. If it does not yet exist, create it. Assuming
    that the file was empty, add the following contents.

    ```json
    {
      "storage-driver": "devicemapper"
    }
    ```

4.  For production systems, you must use `direct-lvm` mode, which requires you
    to prepare the block devices. Follow the procedure in the
    [devicemapper storage driver guide](/engine/userguide/storagedriver/device-mapper-driver.md#configure-direct-lvm-mode-for-production){: target="_blank" class="_" }
    **before starting Docker**.

5.  Start Docker.

    ```bash
    $ sudo systemctl start docker
    ```

6.  Verify that Docker EE is installed correctly by running the `hello-world`
    image.

    ```bash
    $ sudo docker run hello-world
    ```

    This command downloads a test image and runs it in a container. When the
    container runs, it prints an informational message and exits.

Docker EE is installed and running. You need to use `sudo` to run Docker
commands. Continue to [Linux postinstall](linux-postinstall.md) to allow
non-privileged users to run Docker commands and for other optional configuration
steps.



{% elsif section == "upgrade-using-yum-repo" %}

To upgrade Docker EE:

1.  If upgrading to a new major Docker EE version (such as when going from
    Docker 17.03.x to Docker 17.06.x),
    [add the new repository](#set-up-the-repository){: target="_blank" class="_" }.

2.  Follow the
    [installation instructions](#install-docker), choosing the new version you
    want to install.


{% elsif section == "install-using-yum-package" %}

If you cannot use the official Docker repository to install Docker EE, you can
download the `.{{ package-format | downcase }}` file for your release and
install it manually. You will need to download a new file each time you want to
upgrade Docker EE.

{% if linux-dist == "rhel" %}
1.  Enable the `extras` RHEL repository. This ensures access to the
    `container-selinux` package which is required by `docker-ee`.

    ```bash
    $ sudo yum-config-manager --enable rhel-7-server-extras-rpms
    ```

    Alternately, obtain that package manually from Red Hat.
    There is no way to publicly browse this repository.
{% endif %}

1.  Go to the Docker EE repository URL associated with your
    trial or subscription in your browser. Go to
    `{{ linux-dist-url-slug }}/7/x86_64/stable-{{ site.docker_ee_version }}/Packages` and
    download the `.{{ package-format | downcase }}` file for the Docker version
    you want to install.

    {% if linux-dist == "rhel" %}

    > **Note**: If you have trouble with `selinux` using the packages under the
    > `7` directory, try choosing the version-specific directory instead, such
    > as `7.3`.


    {% endif %}

2.  Install Docker EE, changing the path below to the path where you downloaded
    the Docker package.

    ```bash
    $ sudo yum install /path/to/package.rpm
    ```

    Docker is installed but not started. The `docker` group is created, but no
    users are added to the group.

3.  Edit `/etc/docker/daemon.json`. If it does not yet exist, create it.
    Assuming that the file was empty, add the following contents.

    ```json
    {
      "storage-driver": "devicemapper"
    }
    ```

4.  For production systems, you must use `direct-lvm` mode, which requires you
    to prepare the block devices. Follow the procedure in the
    [devicemapper storage driver guide](/engine/userguide/storagedriver/device-mapper-driver.md#configure-direct-lvm-mode-for-production){: target="_blank" class="_" }
    **before starting Docker**.

5.  Start Docker.

    ```bash
    $ sudo systemctl start docker
    ```

6.  Verify that Docker EE is installed correctly by running the `hello-world`
    image.

    ```bash
    $ sudo docker run hello-world
    ```

    This command downloads a test image and runs it in a container. When the
    container runs, it prints an informational message and exits.

Docker EE is installed and running. You need to use `sudo` to run Docker
commands. Continue to [Post-installation steps for Linux](linux-postinstall.md)
to allow non-privileged users to run Docker commands and for other optional
configuration steps.


{% elsif section == "upgrade-using-yum-package" %}

To upgrade Docker EE, download the newer package file and repeat the
[installation procedure](#install-from-a-package), using `yum -y upgrade`
instead of `yum -y install`, and pointing to the new file.

{% elsif section == "yum-uninstall" %}

1.  Uninstall the Docker EE package:

    ```bash
    $ sudo yum -y remove docker-ee
    ```

2.  Images, containers, volumes, or customized configuration files on your host
    are not automatically removed. To delete all images, containers, and
    volumes:

    ```bash
    $ sudo rm -rf /var/lib/docker
    ```

3.  If desired, remove the `devicemapper` thin pool and reformat the block
    devices that were part of it.

You must delete any edited configuration files manually.
